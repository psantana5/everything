TO IMPLEMENT:

ROBUSTNESS: Handle large connections and not crashing/slowing down.

Customizability: Create custom rules, block or allow certain IPs or ranges and other tailored measures.


Logging and reporting: Log all traffic and provide detailed reports on network activity.

Application and identity-based inspection: Ability to operate at Application and Identity level as well as Network.

Hybrid cloud support?

Parental control feature?

DEEP Packet Inspection: analyze the content of network packets beyond header information.

User Authentication and Access Control: Implement user authentication mechanisms to restrict access to the firewall's configuration and management interfaces.

VPN Support!!!


High Availability and Load Balancing!

WEB INTERFACE?

Sandboxing: Consider incorporating sandboxing capabilities to isolate and analyze potentially malicious files or applications within a controlled environment, thus minimizing the risk of infections spreading across the network.
